 *  The override read-back honors the SAME two consent signals `selfTuneRepos` (`review/selftune-wire.ts`) checks
 *  before ever generating a new recommendation: an explicit per-repo `.loopover.yml` `review.selftune: false`
 *  opt-out, and the repo's broader acting-autonomy consent (`isAgentConfigured`). Without this, a repo that
 *  opts out (or has its autonomy fully revoked) AFTER an override was already promoted would keep having that
 *  stale override silently reapplied to every gate decision forever — the only escape hatch would be the
 *  maintainer-only DELETE override route, which nothing surfaces to the operator. Opting out here does NOT
 *  delete the promoted override (a human, or re-opting-in, can still see/clear it) — it just stops it from
 *  being read back while the opt-out is in effect. */
