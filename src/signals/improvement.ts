// Deterministic PR-improvement signal (#4742, sub-issue E of epic #4737): the positive-axis counterpart to
// src/signals/slop.ts's risk-only score. Where slop.ts asks "does this diff look low-effort or risky", this
// module asks "does this diff show measurable structural improvement" — reduced complexity, resolved
// duplication, higher patch coverage, added test evidence. Deterministic tier ONLY: no LLM call lives here.
// The LLM-tier judgment (`ModelReview.valueAssessment`, src/services/ai-review.ts, #4743/#4754) is a
// genuinely separate axis combined with this score at the SURFACING layer (a later sub-issue, #4744) —
// never blended into `improvementScore` itself.
//
// Activation wiring already exists (#4738/#4753: `isImprovementSignalEnabled` + the `improvementSignal`
// ConvergedFeatureKey) but nothing calls `resolveConvergedFeature` for it yet, and this module is not an
// exception — it is a pure, standalone computation consumed only by its own tests until the panel-surfacing
// sub-issue (#4744) wires a caller. It carries NO gate/blocker power (epic design constraint 2): unlike
// slop.ts's header comment ("the ONLY thing allowed to gate"), `improvementScore` must never appear in
// evaluateGateCheck or any blocker path.
//
// Two of the four inputs (complexityDeltas/duplicationDeltas) are REES (review-enrichment service)
// findings. REES is a separate deployable (its own package.json/tsconfig, not a root workspace member — see
// review-enrichment/), so its types are not directly importable here; the shapes below are a structural
// mirror of REES's ComplexityDeltaFinding/DuplicationDeltaFinding (review-enrichment/src/types.ts). As of
// this PR, no channel threads REES's structured `findings` (as opposed to its rendered prompt text) into the
// main app at all — src/review/enrichment-wire.ts only splices REES's pre-rendered { promptSection,
// systemSuffix } into the AI review prompt and never parses `brief.findings`. Likewise, no part of this
// codebase's signal pipeline currently extracts a structured number from Codecov's codecov/patch check (only
// its human-readable text summary reaches src/review/grounding-wire.ts / src/review/unified-comment.ts, e.g.
// "60% of diff hit (target 97%)", for display, not computation). So today, callers of this module have no
// live source for complexityDeltas, duplicationDeltas, or patchCoverageDeltaPercent — all three are honest
// gaps, not yet wired by design (a later sub-issue's job), and this module must degrade cleanly when they're
// absent (see "insufficient signal" below) rather than fabricate a neutral score.
