// Harness submission-gate wiring orchestrator (#2337): the real-IO half of connecting the gated-submission
// decision (`shouldSubmit`, wrapped by `evaluateHarnessSubmissionTrigger`, @jsonbored/gittensory-engine) to a
// real driving loop's own handoff signal. Reads the session's recent decision history to compute the
// consecutive-block circuit-breaker tally, consults the pure decision, and always records exactly one audit
// event -- regardless of outcome, so a paused-pending-human-review session leaves a full trail of why.
//
// NOT WIRED INTO ANY AUTOMATIC SCHEDULE: per this issue's own "manual owner sign-off on the wiring before this
// ships to any default-on profile" deliverable. A real call site (root-side server/CLI integration) invokes
// this function with a real `HandoffPacket`; on `allow: true` it may then build the `open_pr` local-write spec
// itself -- this module does not, and cannot, do that (the spec builder lives in the private root `src/` tree,
// unreachable from this package -- same cross-package-boundary reason self-review-adapter.ts's slop injection
// exists).
//
// SESSION-SCOPED, NOT PER-REPO: the circuit breaker's own "pauses the run entirely" wording means the tally is
// counted across EVERY repo's decisions this session, not scoped to one repo -- distinct from #2338's loop-
// reentry circuit breaker, which is deliberately per-repo (a rejection streak on one repo must not pause
// unrelated repos).
